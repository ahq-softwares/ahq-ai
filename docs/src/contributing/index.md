#### TL;DR for Derivative Owners

If you distribute your modified software (your derivative), the entire work—including all of your new **code—must be licensed under the GPL-3.0 (or a compatible license)**. You cannot change the terms that grant freedom to the next recipient.

Because your **derivative must be under GPL-3.0 (or a compatible license), you are obligated to provide the corresponding source code** to anyone who receives the binary version of your derivative.

This also means that you cannot create a derivative our project and convert it into a closed source, proprietary project with no source code available or under a different license. **Such malpractice might even lead to a legal lawsuit, so be informed.**
